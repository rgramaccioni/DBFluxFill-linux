# DBFluxFill - FLUX.1 Fill Dev inside Nuke (Linux build)

DBFluxFill is a Nuke gizmo that brings [FLUX.1 Fill Dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev) inpainting directly into your Nuke workflow. Connect an image and hit Generate. The result drops back into your node graph as a Read node, ready to comp.

This is the **Linux port** of the original [DBFluxFill](https://github.com/drberkowitz/DBFluxFill) by Daniel Berkowitz. It was built specifically for Nuke artists who may have never used ComfyUI, are not familar with that much Python, or don't want to learn another tool. The installer walks the user through everything, downloads the model components, sets up a portable Python environment, has a Nuke Indie option, and even helps you set up your init.py file.

**License note:** DBFluxFill is a free, open-source tool. The underlying FLUX.1 Fill Dev model is subject to the [FLUX.1 [dev] License](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

## Requirements

**Platform:** Linux (x86_64 or aarch64)
- Installation runs in your terminal as a text-mode wizard — **no desktop session, no X11/Wayland required**. Works fine over plain SSH.
- A desktop session **is** needed for using DBFluxFill inside Nuke (the gizmo opens a terminal window to show generation progress).

**System packages required:** **none**. `setup.sh` downloads a self-contained [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone) Python 3.11 distribution into `./python/`. No `sudo`, no Tcl/Tk system package, no distro-level dependencies on the artist's machine.

**Terminal emulator (for live generation log inside Nuke):** any of `gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, `xfce4-terminal`, `alacritty`, `kitty`, `foot`, `terminator`, `xterm`. If none is available the runner still works — DBFluxFill just won't pop a window and you can `tail -F` the log file yourself.

**Nuke:** Nuke 13.2v8 or later (built for 13.2, but tested on later versions)

**GPU:** Nvidia GPU with CUDA 12.4+ drivers required
- The installer checks this on launch and will warn you if your drivers are out of date
- [Download latest Nvidia drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

**VRAM:** Depends on your chosen model variant (see [Model Variants](#model-variants) below)

**Disk space:** 23 to 35 GB free depending on model variant, plus ~5 GB for the portable Python environment.

**Hugging Face account:** Required. You must accept the FLUX.1 Fill Dev license on Hugging Face before downloading. [Accept the license here](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev).

---

## Installation

### Step 1 — Download and place the folder

Click the green `<> Code` button at the top of this page. Select `Download ZIP` and unzip the downloaded folder.

Rename `DBFluxFill-linux-main` to `DBFluxFill` and copy it into your `.nuke` directory:

```
~/.nuke/DBFluxFill/
```

If you are not sure where your `.nuke` folder is, open Nuke and run this in the Script Editor:

```python
print(nuke.pluginPath())
```

Your `.nuke` folder will be one of the paths listed (typically `~/.nuke`).

### Step 2 — Run the installer

Inside the `DBFluxFill` folder, run:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This launches the DBFluxFill installer, a step-by-step text-mode wizard inside your terminal that handles everything else:

- Downloading and unpacking a portable [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone) Python 3.11 distribution into `./python/` (no system Python or `sudo` required)
- Installing all dependencies (including the correct PyTorch CUDA build)
- Downloading your chosen model variant from Hugging Face
- Writing the configuration file

The installer asks you questions in sequence, one screen at a time:

**Welcome** — Shows system requirements and checks your GPU and CUDA version. If your drivers are too old or no Nvidia GPU is detected, the installer will warn you and ask whether to continue.

**File Paths** — Sets default directories for temporary PNG/seed/log files and output renders as well as the default filename pattern. Pre-populated with sensible defaults. Each field supports Nuke TCL expressions. You can also enable Nuke Indie mode here.

**Model Variant** — Choose which version of FLUX.1 Fill Dev to download (`bf16`, `fp8`, or `gguf`). See [Model Variants](#model-variants) below for a full comparison.

**Model Setup** — Pick automatic download (enter your Hugging Face token + where to store the models) or manual mode (point to existing component folders if you've downloaded them on another machine and copied them over).

**Installing** — The installer sets up the portable Python environment, installs dependencies via `pip`, and downloads the model. A live log streams pip and HuggingFace progress into your terminal. Takes 10-40 minutes depending on internet speed and variant.

**Done** — Shows a summary of what was written and the code snippet you need to add to your `init.py`. Offers to create the `init.py` file for you if it doesn't exist yet.

### Step 3 — Update your init.py

The installer's Done screen displays a code snippet. Add it to your `~/.nuke/init.py` file. It will look like this:

```python
import DBFluxFill
nuke.pluginAddPath('./DBFluxFill')
```

If you do not have an `init.py` yet, the Done screen offers to create one for you automatically.

Once this is done, restart Nuke. DBFluxFill will appear in the toolbar.

## Model Variants

Three versions of FLUX.1 Fill Dev are supported. All three require you to accept the FLUX.1 Fill Dev license on Hugging Face before downloading.

| | bf16 | fp8 | gguf |
|---|---|---|---|
| **VRAM** | 16 GB+ recommended | 12 GB+ recommended | 10 GB+ recommended |
| **Disk** | ~34.3 GB | ~22.3 GB | ~23.1 GB |
| **Speed** | Baseline | Faster | Conditional |
| **Quality** | Full | Slight tradeoff | Slight tradeoff |
| **Source** | Black Forest Labs (official) | AlekseyCalvin + BFL components | YarvixPA Q5_1 + BFL components |

### bf16

The official FLUX.1 Fill Dev release in full diffusers format. Highest quality, highest VRAM requirement. Best choice if you have 16 GB+ VRAM and need the best quality.

- HuggingFace: [black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev)

### fp8

Uses the fp8-quantized AlekseyCalvin repo modified only by a small config.json change. Noticeably faster than bf16 with a minor quality tradeoff. Requires an Ampere GPU or newer (RTX 30xx+).

The installer applies a required `config.json` patch to the transformer after download automatically.

- HuggingFace: [AlekseyCalvin/FluxFillDev_fp8_Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/AlekseyCalvin/FluxFillDev_fp8_Diffusers)

### gguf

Uses a GGUF Q5_1 quantized transformer from YarvixPA with the official BFL VAE, encoders, and scheduler. Lowest VRAM requirement of the three variants. A good option for 10-12 GB and older cards.

The installer applies a required `config.json` patch and places the `.gguf` file correctly.

- HuggingFace: [YarvixPA/FLUX.1-Fill-dev-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/YarvixPA/FLUX.1-Fill-dev-GGUF)

*To switch variants later, re-run `./setup.sh` and select a different variant. The installer will update dependencies and rewrite `config.json`. If you want to free the disk space used by the previous variant, delete the models folder before re-running.*

---

## Manual Model Setup

If you prefer to download model components yourself rather than using a Hugging Face token, select **"I want to configure model components manually instead"** on the Model Setup screen of the installer.

The manual setup screen lists every component required, with direct links to the correct Hugging Face repositories and approximate file sizes. You point the installer at your local directories for each component and it writes the config accordingly.

### Components by variant

**bf16 components:**

All components come from [black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev). The expected folder structure inside the models directory is:

```
models/
    transformer/
    vae/
    text_encoder/
    text_encoder_2/
    tokenizer/
    tokenizer_2/
    scheduler/
```

**fp8 components:**

All components from [AlekseyCalvin/FluxFillDev_fp8_Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/AlekseyCalvin/FluxFillDev_fp8_Diffusers). The folder structure should match the above bf16 models directory.

After downloading, you must overwrite `transformer/config.json` with the one from the BFL repo at `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev/transformer/config.json`. The manual setup screen shows a config.json row for this compontent.

**gguf components:**

- Transformer file: download `flux1-fill-dev-Q5_1.gguf` from [YarvixPA/FLUX.1-Fill-dev-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/YarvixPA/FLUX.1-Fill-dev-GGUF) and place it in a `transformer/` folder
- `transformer/config.json`: copy from [black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev/tree/main/transformer) The manual setup screen shows a config.json row for this component.
- All other components: from [black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev)

## Using DBFluxFill

### Setting up the node

1. Add `DBFluxFill` from the toolbar to your node graph (or search in the node graph).
2. Connect your image to the **img** input and your mask to the **mask** input. You can embed an alpha into the image input if you don't want to use the mask input, the gizmo handles both.
3. Your image and mask will be automatically cropped and scaled to a valid FLUX resolution (multiples of 16, minimum 272x272). If your image is larger than 2048px or smaller than 512px on either axis, the gizmo will warn you before generating.

### Generating

**Main tab knobs:**

- **Prompt** — Describe what you want to fill the masked area with. Not needed usually, but can help steer the generated image.
- **Seed** — Set to `-1` for a random seed each run, or enter a specific value to reproduce a result. The Randomize button sets it to `-1`.
- **Steps** — Number of diffusion steps. Default is 20. More steps generally means more detail but slower generation.
- **Guidance** — Controls how closely the output follows your prompt. Default is 2.5.
- **Prev Selector** — Switches the node's viewer output between your input and the pre-processed version sent to FLUX. Useful for checking what the model will actually see.
- **Mask Overlay** — Overlays a red mask in the viewer so you can see coverage.
- **Frame Hold** — Which frame from your input is used for generation. The gizmo will default to the frame the viewer is on when you drop the node down.
- **Mask Invert** — Inverts which area is treated as the fill region.
- **Crop to Mask** — When enabled (default), the gizmo crops the working area to the bounding box of your mask plus padding, which is faster. When disabled, the full image is sent to the model.
- **Crop Padding** — Pixels of padding added around the mask bounding box when Crop to Mask is on. Default is 25.

**Paths tab:**

Defaults are from the config.json which is setup in the Installer.

- **Temp Dir** — Where intermediate PNG files are written during generation. Supports TCL expressions.
- **Output Dir** — Where the final output PNG is saved. Supports TCL expressions.
- **Output Name** — The filename for the output. All outputs are saved as 16-bit PNG files.

When you hit **Generate**, Nuke will open a terminal window showing the inference progress. Nuke itself will be unresponsive until generation completes. This is expected behaviour (see [Important Notes](#important-notes)).

**Generate (Keep Loaded)** opens a persistent terminal window that tails the live log and keeps the model in VRAM between generations. Subsequent runs skip the load step entirely. When you are done generating, click **Unload Model** to close the window, free VRAM, and clean up the temp log file.

When generation finishes, a Read node is dropped into your node graph with the result. It includes a **DBFluxFill Settings** tab showing the seed, steps, guidance, and prompt used, all read-only for reference.

---

## Important Notes

**Nuke freezes during generation.** When you hit Generate, Nuke will be unresponsive until the model finishes. The terminal window that opens shows inference progress. This is a subprocess architecture tradeoff. The model runs in an isolated Python environment to keep its memory separate from Nuke's. Use **Generate (Keep Loaded)** to keep the model in VRAM between generations, skipping the load time on subsequent runs.

**Linux only.** This is the Linux build. For Windows, use the original [DBFluxFill](https://github.com/drberkowitz/DBFluxFill) repository. macOS is not supported.

**Portable Python.** DBFluxFill ships with a self-contained [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone) Python 3.11 distribution (downloaded by `setup.sh` into `./python/`). It does not depend on your system Python at any point. The installer wizard runs as text in your terminal — no Tkinter, no X11, no `sudo`, nothing to install at the system level.

**Terminal emulator detection.** DBFluxFill probes for common terminal emulators in this order: `x-terminal-emulator`, `gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, `xfce4-terminal`, `mate-terminal`, `lxterminal`, `alacritty`, `kitty`, `foot`, `tilix`, `terminator`, `urxvt`, `xterm`. The first one found is used to open the live log window. If none is installed, the runner still works — you can monitor progress with `tail -F` on the log file path printed in the Nuke script editor.

**config.json** in the folder also stores your temp directory, output directory, and output filename defaults set during installation. These can be edited directly in `config.json` at any time without re-running the installer. The file lives at `~/.nuke/DBFluxFill/config.json`

**Nuke 13.2 and later.** Designed for Nuke 13.2v8. Tested on later Nuke versions.

**VRAM floors are recommendations, not hard limits.** Generation may still run below the recommended VRAM amounts depending on your image resolution, but expect slower performance or out-of-memory errors at very high resolutions.

**Resolution limits.** The gizmo will warn you if your input is larger than 2048px or smaller than 512px on either axis. Very large inputs are not recommended and may exceed your VRAM. Very small inputs may produce poor unpredictable results.

**fp8 requires Ampere GPU or newer.** The fp8 variant uses float8 quantization which requires an RTX 30xx series card or newer. It will not run on Turing (RTX 20xx) or older.

**Nuke Indie.** DBFluxFill supports Nuke Indie. Indie mode is set during installation and affects how certain dialogs and file operations work inside Nuke. If you are on Indie, make sure to check the Indie mode box on the File Paths screen during install. This flag can be changed in the config.json as well.

## Notes for studio deployment

If you are distributing this folder to a VFX team for internal testing, here is what each artist needs to know and what to watch out for.

### Getting the files onto the artist's machine

- **Clone via Git (recommended):** the executable bit on `setup.sh` and LF line endings are preserved automatically. The included `.gitattributes` enforces this even if the repo passes through a Windows machine.
- **ZIP download from GitHub:** the executable bit is **not** preserved. After unzipping, the artist must run `chmod +x setup.sh` before launching it.
- **Shared network drive:** fine, but the artist should *copy* the folder into their own `~/.nuke/DBFluxFill/` before running `setup.sh` — the installer writes `python/`, `models/`, and `config.json` next to the script, so a read-only network location won't work.

### Per-machine prerequisites the artist must already have

| Need | How to check |
|---|---|
| Nvidia driver with CUDA 12.4+ | `nvidia-smi` shows `CUDA Version: 12.4` or higher |
| glibc 2.17 or newer (for portable Python) | `ldd --version` — any distro from CentOS 7 / Ubuntu 14.04 onwards is fine |
| ~30 GB free on the `.nuke` partition | up to 25 GB models + ~150 MB portable Python + ~3 GB PyTorch wheels |
| A desktop session (only for actually *using* DBFluxFill in Nuke) | the installer wizard itself is text-mode and works over plain SSH |

**No `sudo` is required.** The portable Python is installed entirely under `~/.nuke/DBFluxFill/python/` (it's just an extracted tarball — no root, no system-wide changes). The installer wizard runs in the terminal, so artists do not need a desktop session or any X11 forwarding to complete setup.

### Pre-downloading on studios with restricted internet

`setup.sh` and the installer both download from the public internet by default:

- Portable Python: a ~30 MB tarball from `github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone`
- PyTorch CUDA wheels: ~2 GB from `download.pytorch.org`
- FLUX components: 23–35 GB from `huggingface.co`

If artist machines can't reach those hosts:

1. **Portable Python**: download `cpython-3.11.9+20240814-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-install_only.tar.gz` (or the `aarch64` variant) from [github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20240814](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20240814) on a machine that can, rename it to `python-embed.tar.gz`, and drop it next to `setup.sh` before running. The script picks it up automatically.
2. **Models**: download all FLUX components on a machine with internet, then answer "yes" to the **"Use manual mode"** question in the Model Setup step of the installer to point at a local copy (a shared network path works for this — only `python/` needs to be local).
3. **PyTorch wheels**: there is no built-in mirror toggle, so the artist's machine still needs `download.pytorch.org` reachable during install. If your studio has an internal PyPI mirror you can edit `_run_install_deps` in `installer.py` to use `--index-url <your-mirror>`.

### Quick smoke test the tester should run after install

1. Open Nuke, confirm the **DBFluxFill** menu appears in the node toolbar.
2. Drop a DBFluxFill node, connect an image (~1024×1024) and a small mask.
3. Click **Generate**. A terminal window should appear with inference progress.
4. After 1–3 minutes (depending on GPU), a Read node should drop into the graph with a **DBFluxFill Settings** tab.
5. Optionally: click **Generate (Stay Loaded)** twice in a row. The second run should skip the load step and complete much faster.
6. Click **Unload Model** at the end. The terminal window should close and VRAM should be freed.

### Common test issues to expect

- *"Portable Python not found"* in the installer → the user clicked the desktop launcher for `installer.py` directly instead of running `./setup.sh`. The installer requires `setup.sh` to have unpacked `./python/` first.
- *No terminal window opens on Generate* → none of the supported terminal emulators are installed. Either install one (`gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, `xterm`, etc.) or just have the artist run `tail -F <log path printed in the Nuke script editor>` in their own terminal.
- *CUDA out of memory* → drop to the `gguf` variant, lower the input resolution, or shrink the crop padding. Documented in [Important Notes](#important-notes).
- *Nuke complains about `import DBFluxFill`* → the `~/.nuke/init.py` snippet from the installer's Done screen was not added, or the folder is not named exactly `DBFluxFill`.
